# WrestleGPT
This is a web based app where the user inputs two names and ChatGPT writes a recap of a professional wrestling match between the two people.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Axios, Mongoose, OpenAI API, Passport

I started this project as a minimal NodeJS back end that requests a simple prompt from the ChatGPT API using Axios.  For the styling, I just used plain Bootstrap for simplicity. It is not fully implemented yet, but I intend to use MongoDB to have a database of people to choose from with a few properties, and hope to flesh it into more than a paragraph generator.

I have also used Passport to create user Authentication to prevent anyone but me from using the OpenAI API.

## Optimizations

Right now, this app is in a basic state where nothing has been refactored, as I am still toying around with the design to figure out what it will end up.

## Lessons Learned:

This is the first app I created using the OpenAI API, and I learned many lessons about how to use it to send and receive information from their API.
